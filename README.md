Road Accident Data Analysis - End-to-End ML Workflow


# 🚦 Road Accident Data Analysis – End-to-End ML Workflow

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **machine learning workflow** to analyze road accident data, identify patterns, and make predictions to improve road safety. The workflow covers **data collection, preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model development, and evaluation**.

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset includes real-world accident records with attributes such as:
- **Date & Time** – Timestamp of the accident.
- **Location** – Geographic coordinates or city/region details.
- **Weather Conditions** – Environmental factors at the time of the accident.
- **Vehicle Type** – Types of vehicles involved.
- **Severity** – Categorization (Minor, Serious, Fatal).
- **Road Type** – Highway, urban road, rural road, intersection.
- **Cause** – Probable reasons (speeding, drunk driving, visibility, etc.).

## 🔍 ML Workflow Steps
1️⃣ **Data Collection & Cleaning** – Handle missing values, duplicate records, and inconsistencies.  
2️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualize trends using **Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib**.  
3️⃣ **Feature Engineering** – Transform variables, encode categorical data.  
4️⃣ **Model Selection & Training** – Compare models such as **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost**.  
5️⃣ **Hyperparameter Tuning** – Optimize models using **GridSearchCV** or **Bayesian optimization**.  
6️⃣ **Evaluation & Deployment** – Assess model performance with metrics like **Accuracy, F1-score, Confusion Matrix** and prepare for deployment.
